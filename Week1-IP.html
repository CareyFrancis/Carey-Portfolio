      <p>Here is a list of the projects that i have been able to create so far :
        <ul>
          <li><span class="project">My First Web Page x</span><a href="https://github.com/CareyFrancis/first-webpage"> here</a></li>
              This is the first web page I created in Moringa School. A combination of HTML and CSS languages was used to accomplish the task.
          <li><span class="project">Cookie Recipe </span><a href="https://github.com/CareyFrancis/cookie-recipe"> here</a></li>
              This is a project that I forked from Github to correct spacing and indentation errors.
          <li><span class="project">My First Project </span><a href="https://github.com/CareyFrancis/hello-world"> here</a></li>
              This is my first project. The traditional "Hello World". Only HTML was used to create this project.
        </ul>
